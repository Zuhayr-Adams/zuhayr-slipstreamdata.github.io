👋 Hello, I'm Zuhayr Adams

## 📓 Mini Bio
I’m an aspiring data scientist with a passion for finance and storytelling through data. My love for movies has shaped the way I think about analysis: films often end on cliffhangers, and while waiting for the next release, I find myself overanalyzing the plot, characters, and clues to predict what might happen next. This same curiosity drives my approach to data science—using available information to ask questions, test ideas, and forecast future outcomes. Now, I want to apply this mindset to financial data to uncover insights that can guide smarter decisions.  

## 🎯 Target Role
**Data Scientist** – I’m excited about this role because it blends technical skills, creativity, and critical thinking. In finance, this means being able to interpret complex data, spot trends, and communicate insights that make a tangible difference.  

## 💡 Seed Project Ideas
- **Market Trend Prediction Model**: Use open stock or cryptocurrency datasets to explore how volume, volatility, and sentiment interact with price movements.  
- **Financial Dashboard**: Build a dashboard that visualizes returns, risk, and volatility over time, helping users interpret where the market may be moving.  

## 🛠️ Skills to Grow
- **Technical Skill**: Data Visualization – developing proficiency in Power BI and Tableau to clearly communicate insights.  
- **Soft Skill**: Communication – explaining complex financial findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.  

## 🚀 Goals
- **30-day goal**: Complete an online Power BI or Tableau course and apply it to a small financial dataset.  
- **6-month goal**: Publish my first market analysis project on GitHub, complete with visualizations and a blog-style write-up of insights.
