ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Zuhayr Adams
Welcome to my data science portfolio!
I'm a curious and driven data scientist with a passion for turning complex data into clear, actionable insights. This space showcases my journey through real-world projects, where I explore data, build models, and communicate findings in meaningful ways.

Each project reflects not just technical skills, but also how I approach problems, think critically, and tell compelling stories with data. Whether it's predictive modelling, visual analytics, or working with big data tools, I aim to make data work for people.

Thanks for visitingâ€”feel free to explore, connect, or reach out!
